The overall project will be a **microservices-based e-commerce platform** that integrates **Spring Cloud** with **message queues/brokers** (RabbitMQ and optionally Kafka later). Here's an outline of how the system will look:

### Microservices Overview:

1. **Product Service**:
    - Manages products (CRUD operations for products like adding/removing items).
    - Registered with Eureka for service discovery.
    - Exposes REST APIs for product-related queries.

2. **Order Service**:
    - Handles customer orders.
    - Sends messages to RabbitMQ when an order is placed.
    - Registered with Eureka for service discovery.
    - Uses circuit breakers for fault tolerance when interacting with other services (like Inventory and Payment).

3. **Customer Service**:
    - Manages customer profiles.
    - Registered with Eureka for service discovery.
    - Stores customer-related information and exposes APIs for customer management.

4. **Inventory Service**:
    - Manages product stock levels.
    - Consumes messages from RabbitMQ when new orders are placed (to adjust stock).
    - Registered with Eureka.
    - Optionally, later integrates Kafka to handle large-scale inventory updates.

5. **Payment Service**:
    - Simulates payment processing.
    - Integrated with Order Service to process payments.
    - Uses RabbitMQ for event-based communication and asynchronous processing.

6. **Notification Service**:
    - Sends notifications (via email or SMS) when an order is processed.
    - Listens to RabbitMQ queues for order completion events.
    - Optionally expanded later to consume events from Kafka if we add real-time customer activity tracking.

### Supporting Services:

1. **Spring Cloud Config**:
    - Manages configurations for all microservices centrally. Each service will pull its configurations dynamically based on environment (dev, prod).

2. **Spring Cloud Gateway**:
    - Acts as the single entry point for all client requests.
    - Handles routing to appropriate microservices.
    - Secures access to services using OAuth2 and JWT tokens.

3. **Eureka (Service Discovery)**:
    - Manages service registry, allowing microservices to discover and communicate with each other without hardcoded IP addresses.

4. **Spring Cloud Sleuth & Zipkin (Distributed Tracing)**:
    - Provides visibility into distributed requests between microservices.
    - Tracks transactions across services, helping with debugging and monitoring.

5. **RabbitMQ (Message Broker)**:
    - Facilitates asynchronous communication between services.
    - Order Service acts as the producer, Inventory and Notification services act as consumers.
    - Optionally later, Kafka will be integrated for larger, high-throughput streaming scenarios.

### Message Queue Flow (RabbitMQ):

1. **Order Placement**:
    - Order Service sends an **OrderPlaced** event to RabbitMQ.
    - Inventory Service consumes the message and adjusts stock levels.
    - Notification Service consumes the same event and sends a notification to the customer.

2. **Inventory Update**:
    - Inventory Service processes the order by adjusting stock levels asynchronously.

3. **Order Completion**:
    - After inventory update and payment processing, the **OrderCompleted** event is sent to RabbitMQ.
    - Notification Service consumes this event and sends a final notification to the customer about their order status.

---

### Optional Kafka Expansion:

1. **Kafka Stream**:
    - Once you're comfortable with RabbitMQ, we can introduce Kafka for **event streaming**. For example, Kafka can be used to track customer activity in real-time, analyzing order frequency or product demand.

2. **Order Tracking**:
    - Instead of just sending order events via RabbitMQ, you can set up **Kafka topics** to handle large-scale, real-time order tracking.

---

### Technology Stack:

- **Spring Cloud Components**: Eureka, Config, Gateway, Sleuth, Zipkin, Resilience4j
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ (Kafka later)
- **Security**: Spring Security (OAuth2 + JWT)
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL for storing product, customer, and order data
- **Docker**: All services should be Dockerized for easy management and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring (optional but recommended)

---

### Development Milestones:

1. **Basic Services Setup (Week 1-2)**:
    - Set up Eureka, Config, and Gateway with Product, Order, and Customer services.
2. **RabbitMQ Integration (Week 3)**:
    - Set up RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging between Order, Inventory, and Notification services.
3. **Fault Tolerance and Resilience (Week 4-5)**:
    - Add Resilience4j for circuit breakers and retry mechanisms.
4. **Security Integration (Week 6)**:
    - Secure services with OAuth2 and JWT using the Gateway as the entry point.
5. **Distributed Tracing (Week 7)**:
    - Add Sleuth and Zipkin to trace requests across services.
6. **Kafka Integration (Week 8+, Optional)**:
    - Integrate Kafka for more advanced event streaming.

This project will give you hands-on experience with both **Spring Cloud** and **message queues** while building a system that's applicable in real-world scenarios. Youâ€™ll start with RabbitMQ for easier learning and later explore Kafka for more advanced use cases.
